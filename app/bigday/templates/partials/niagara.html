                Those coming from the US might find it cheaper to drive to Buffalo or fly to Buffalo  International Airport.
                The domestic flights to Buffalo are typically more cost-effective than flying internationally to Toronto.
                However, be sure to bring your passports and factor in additional travel time for the border crossing.
